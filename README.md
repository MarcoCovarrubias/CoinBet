# CoinBet
Dapp for betting ETH by fliping a coin. Tails/head result is decentralized, being generated by an oracle.

The interface is pretty simple and lacks a lot of interactivity (Still new to html and js). There is a video in this folder that shows how the dapp works (https://github.com/MarcoCovarrubias/CoinBet/blob/main/CoinBet.mp4). First the user requests a bet by selecting how much ETH she/he wants to bet, then hit the TOSS THE COIN! button and waits for the transaction to complete, and for the oracle to generate the random number. The output can be seen in the console. The dapp ask to the user to wait for the result and then to check her/his wallet once the result is ready.
